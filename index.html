                <h1>Treaty 5 <br/>(The Winnipeg Treaty)</h1>
                <p id="header-paragraph">The fifth Treaty, also called the Winnipeg Treaty was made in 1875-1876, and was signed by the Federal Government of Canada, the Saulteaux and Swamby Cree Indigenous peoples. The main purpose of Treaty 5 was to secure safe transport to western Canada through Lake Winnipeg so that securing more treaties would be easier.</p>

                <h2>The Treaty</h2>
                <p>Commissioners Alexander Morris and James McKay, a known polyglot, were the main 'negotiators' on behalf of the Queen. The Treaty was negotiated primarily at Beren's River and Norway House on september 20-24</p>
                <p>James McKay also had parts in negotiating Treaties 1, 2, 3, and 6 along with Treaty 5.</p>
                <p>The Treaty was to affect most of northern Manitoba and small parts of Saskatchewan and Ontario.</p>
                <p> Since the land specified by the Treaty was seen as less valueable the commissioners were able to offer less compensation than previous Treaties (especially Treaties 3 and 4).</p>
                <p>The people that were affected by Treaty 5 got $5 instead of the $12 given in Treaties 3 and 4, they also only got 160 acers of land per family of 5 instead of the 640 the peoples of Treaties 3 and 4 got.</p>
                <p>The Treaty also promised agricultural tools which were often inadequate in both quality and quantity.</p>

            <h2>Consequences of Treaty 5</h2>
                <p>The loss of a majority of land made for cramped living quarters and over population, it also increased poverty.</p>
                <p>The inadequate tools for farming made starvation much more common and poverty because they couldn't sell produce they didn't have.</p>
                <p>Most importantly of all the decrease in space, introduction of more often use of agriculture and a change in laws interupted the traditions and beliefs of all affected.</p>
